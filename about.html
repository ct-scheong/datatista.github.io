<a id="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>
<p>The first job I ever had was a community engagement internship at a small gaming startup that was trying to break into the US market. I helped manage social media channels, answer support tickets, and facilitate usability sessions. It was here that I found myself interested in the numbers side of things, and how I can use data to better engage with the userbase.
I recall my manager at the time saying "You know, you should really consider being a business analyst". And down the data rabbit hole I went. </p>

<p>I am currently a Data Scientist at Getty Images focused on improving customer retention (CLTV, churn risk) and optimizing marketing spend (MMM) using machine learning techniques. Previously, I was a Data Scientist at Oracle CrowdTwist, where I help brands unlock data insights to engage with their most loyal customers. As a "full-stack" data scientist, I do everything from data plumbing (aka "ETL"), data cleaning, to modeling and analysis. I'm tool agnostic, and use whatever best fits the situation (though heavily focused on Python/SQL).</p>

<p></p>A native New Yorker, I can tell you which dollar pizza place is the best (yes it's 2 Bros, but ONLY the one on St.Mark's). In my spare time I enjoy Yoga (I am a <a href="https://www.yogaalliance.org/TeacherPublicProfile?tid=280877">Registered Yoga Teacher</a>), drawing, and art museums.  I recently got into baking too, after watching one too many episodes of the Great British Bakeoff.</p>
